# Millennial RPG
- 2D Choose-Your-Own Adventure style RPG
- Step into the shoes of someone coming of age during the Information Age. Between student loan debt and avocado toast, this is a truly immersive and authentic experience.
- Character begins with base stats: intelligence, charisma, influence, and money (may add more further into development).
- As the character progresses through their life, they will hit certain milestones and make decisions that will alter their future.
  - Will you be a jock, or will you play sports to appease your parents and receive a participation trophy?
  - Choose to delve into the dark world of social media - sign up for Facebook, Twitter, and/or Instagram - and deal with the perils/consequences/rewards therein.
  - Will you head off to college and take on massive student loan debt? Your parents certainly aren't going to help you pay for it.
  - Choose to become an Instagram influencer and spend way too much time taking pictures of your food.
  - Graduate college and look for an entry level job - surprise, you need 2 years experience for any entry level position!
- Small choices have an effect on game progression too - purchasing a car/bike or choosing to walk to work. Living in the city or the suburbs, choice of housing (rent or live with your parents). Each choice will have an effect on various stats. An element of randomness is implemented into the game, so not everything may go exactly the way the user hopes for.
